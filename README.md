# RunningWithMusic

This app was made for the [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) final project.

You can see the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqeKGN9eDtuJBJL1MBxJW5zvfuh1UBLNqpNtcbWyWZ4/pub?embedded=true#h.9awt3omj1ynm) for this project. It exceeded the specifications.

This app uses the major Android SDK resources (Activities, Services, Intents, Broadcast Receiver, Notifications, Widget, Google Play Services, Google Maps API, Media Player, Content Provider).

I developed it using MVP with Dagger2 as dependency injection framework. I used Butterknife as well.

This app is not a final product. It was made as portfolio project.
